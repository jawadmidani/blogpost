    <h1>Performing a Comprehensive Risk Assessment and Building a Robust Disaster Recovery Plan</h1>
    <p class="highlight"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>In an era of increasing cyberattacks, hardware failures, and operational risks, organisations like Vodafone must establish proactive strategies to ensure business continuity. IT security revolves around the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad) of data and systems. One of the foundational components of IT security is conducting a Risk Assessment, which identifies vulnerabilities and prioritises corrective measures.</p>
    <p>A well-structured Risk Assessment informs the creation of an Organisational Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)—a structured strategy to recover from disruptions swiftly and ensure minimal downtime.</p>
    <p>This blog post will provide:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A step-by-step review of Risk Assessment procedures, supported by detailed illustrations and tables.</li>
        <li>An overview of the ISO/IEC 27001 framework and its application to IT Security.</li>
        <li>An explanation of data protection regulations (GDPR) applicable to organisations such as Vodafone.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>1. In-Depth Review of Risk Assessment Procedures</h2>
    <p>A Risk Assessment is the process of identifying, analysing, and evaluating risks to critical organisational assets. It aims to prioritise risks based on impact and likelihood while ensuring appropriate mitigations are implemented.</p>
    
    <h3>Steps of a Risk Assessment Process</h3>
    <h4>Step 1: Identify Organisational Assets</h4>
    <p>The first step is to identify assets—everything critical to the organisation’s operations. This can include:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Asset Category</th>
            <th>Examples</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Physical Assets</td>
            <td>Servers, data centres, routers, laptops.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Digital Assets</td>
            <td>Customer data, databases, cloud services.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Personnel Assets</td>
            <td>Employees, contractors, and IT teams.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Operational Assets</td>
            <td>Network infrastructure, software systems.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h4>Step 2: Identify Threats and Vulnerabilities</h4>
    <p>A threat is any event or circumstance that can cause harm, while a vulnerability is a weakness that a threat can exploit. Below is an example table identifying 10 risks to Vodafone’s systems:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Asset</th>
            <th>Threat</th>
            <th>Vulnerability</th>
            <th>Impact</th>
            <th>Likelihood</th>
            <th>Risk Level</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Customer Database</td>
            <td>Cyberattack (e.g., SQL Injection)</td>
            <td>Weak input validation</td>
            <td>High</td>
            <td>High</td>
            <td>Critical</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Employee Laptops</td>
            <td>Malware Infection</td>
            <td>Lack of antivirus software</td>
            <td>Medium</td>
            <td>High</td>
            <td>High</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>IoT Devices</td>
            <td>Unauthorised Access</td>
            <td>Weak default passwords</td>
            <td>Medium</td>
            <td>High</td>
            <td>High</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Customer Support Systems</td>
            <td>Insider Threat</td>
            <td>Excessive user privileges</td>
            <td>High</td>
            <td>Low</td>
            <td>Medium</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Wireless Networks</td>
            <td>Man-in-the-Middle Attack</td>
            <td>Unsecured Wi-Fi configurations</td>
            <td>Medium</td>
            <td>Medium</td>
            <td>Medium</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h4>Step 3: Assess Risks Using a Risk Matrix</h4>
    <p>Risks are prioritised based on their Impact and Likelihood. Use a Risk Matrix to visualise this:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Likelihood \ Impact</th>
            <th>Low Impact</th>
            <th>Medium Impact</th>
            <th>High Impact</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Low Likelihood</td>
            <td>Low</td>
            <td>Low</td>
            <td>Medium</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Medium Likelihood</td>
            <td>Low</td>
            <td>Medium</td>
            <td>High</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>High Likelihood</td>
            <td>Medium</td>
            <td>High</td>
            <td>Critical</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h4>Step 4: Mitigate Risks with Appropriate Controls</h4>
    <p>Risks can be mitigated using one of the following strategies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoidance: Eliminating the activity causing the risk.</li>
        <li>Mitigation: Reducing risk with technical or procedural controls.</li>
        <li>Transfer: Shifting responsibility (e.g., purchasing insurance).</li>
        <li>Acceptance: Accepting low-level risks that are unlikely to cause damage.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Step 5: Continuous Monitoring and Review</h4>
    <p>Risks evolve as technology and threats change. Therefore, organisations must continuously monitor systems, conduct regular risk assessments, and revise mitigation strategies accordingly.</p>
    
    <h2>2. ISO/IEC 27001 Framework for IT Security</h2>
    <p>ISO/IEC 27001 is an international standard for establishing and improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). It provides a systematic approach to managing information security risks.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Features of ISO/IEC 27001</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Risk-Based Approach: Emphasis on identifying and mitigating risks.</li>
        <li>Security Controls: Includes 114 controls across 14 categories, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Access Control: Limit access to systems and data (A.9).</li>
                <li>Incident Management: Reporting and mitigating incidents (A.16).</li>
                <li>Backup and Recovery: Ensure data redundancy (A.12).</li>
